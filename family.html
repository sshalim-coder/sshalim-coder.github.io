  <h2>🧕 From a Mom:</h2>
  <p>"Baby, I’m proud of you. I know life gets heavy, but look at you — you’re still here. Make sure you eat, okay? You need your strength. You are never too much, and you are always enough."</p>

  <h2>👨‍🦳 From a Dad:</h2>
  <p>"You don’t have to have it all figured out. You’re doing better than you think. Keep your head up — I believe in you. And I always will."</p>

  <h2>👧 From a Big Sister:</h2>
  <p>"Hey, don’t be so hard on yourself. Cry it out if you need to. Then fix your crown and keep going. I’m cheering for you even on your quiet days."</p>
